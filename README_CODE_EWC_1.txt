trying to extract data on Education, wealth and caste. 

For now I wasn't sucessful with Caste so please ignore all data relate to caste in EWC_1
............................................................................................
1 )  WEALTH : 

BMI abnormal rises steeply by wealth
Poorest → Richest: ~21% → ~55%.
This is the classic nutrition transition gradient—higher wealth tracks with higher adiposity.

Waist abnormal (central obesity) rises even more strongly
~26% → ~57%.
This is a particularly clean SES gradient and often a better cardiometabolic risk signal than BMI alone.

Blood pressure abnormal rises modestly with wealth
~8.6% → ~11%.
The slope exists but is not dramatic at the 140/90 threshold. 

Glucose abnormal also rises with wealth but from a low base
~0.7% → ~2.0%.
this is a random glucose cut-point of 200 mg/dL—very specific but not sensitive—so the prevalence will look small and the gradient will look gentle.

Hemoglobin abnormal (anemia) declines with wealth
~65% → ~52%.
This inverse gradient matches expectation: higher wealth → better diet/iron status, less anemia.

NOTE:The healthy baseline (all five normal) is ~18.25% and appears as the third control bar

2) EDUCATION :

Blood pressure (BP)
Clear education gradient downward.
No education: ~14.4% (well above the all-women 9.9%).
Primary: ~12.8% (above average).
Secondary: ~8.2% (now below average).
Higher: ~6.5% (lowest).
More schooling ↔ markedly lower hypertension prevalence. This matches what professor said.

Glucose (random capillary)
All small numbers, mild pattern.
No edu/Primary: ~1.7–1.9% (a bit above the 1.42% overall).
Secondary: ~1.3%; Higher: ~0.9% (below overall).
Overall RBG elevations are rare; there’s a slight improvement with education

BMI
Higher education → more high BMI.
No education: ~36.1% (≈ overall).
Primary: ~40.6% (above overall).
Secondary: ~36.4% (≈ overall).
Higher: ~43.9% (highest).
As education rises, BMI abnormality tends to increase. This likely tracks urbanization, occupations, diet/activity

Waist circumference 
Same direction as BMI — bigger with more education.
No education: ~40.6% (≈ overall 41.0%).
Primary: ~43.6% (above).
Secondary: ~38.8% (slightly below).
Higher: ~47.1% (highest).
Interpretation: Central adiposity follows the BMI pattern: more in the more educated groups.

Hemoglobin
Anemia falls with education.
No education / Primary: ~59.9–60.0% (above overall 57.9%).
Secondary: ~58.3% (near overall).
Higher: ~51.9% (meaningfully lower).
Interpretation: Anemia burden is notably less among women with higher education—likely reflecting diet quality, supplementation, health access/knowledge.
