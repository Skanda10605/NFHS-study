Data hygiene (key points):

Used DHS weights v005/1e6.

Per-metric denominators = women with data for that metric.

“Fully normal” = all five metrics present and all five normal.

Outlier guards: improbable BMI (<10 or ≥60), BP (SBP<70/≥260 or DBP<40/≥150), Hb (2–20 g/dL), waist (40–150 cm), glucose (40–500 mg/dL).

After cleaning, women with all 5 measures: ~682,775.

Baseline results (weighted)

Cut-offs: BMI≥23, BP≥140/90, Glucose≥200 mg/dL, Waist≥80 cm, Hb<12.0 g/dL.

BMI abnormal: 37.95%

BP abnormal: 9.88%

Glucose abnormal: 1.42% (random sugar, stringent by design)

Waist abnormal: 41.04%

Hemoglobin abnormal: 57.89%

Fully normal (among all five present): 18.25%

Sensitivity to thresholds (weighted)

All scenarios are in section1_threshold_sensitivity.csv; cut-offs stored in thresholds.yml.

Liberal Hb (11.5 g/dL): Hb abnormal 45.35%; Fully normal = 24.25%.

Tight BP (130/80): BP abnormal 39.11%; Fully normal = 13.11%.

BMI≥25: BMI abnormal 23.88%; Fully normal = 20.55%.

Waist≥88 cm: Waist abnormal 20.42%; Fully normal = 21.68%.

BMI≥25 & Waist≥88: Fully normal = 26.07%.

BMI≥25 & Waist≥88 & BP 130/80: Fully normal = 17.80%.

… with Hb 11.5: Fully normal = 23.81%.

Most common combinations (weighted, base; among women with ≥1 abnormality and all five present):

HGB only: ~29.22%

BMI + WAIST + HGB: 12.84%

BMI + WAIST: 10.66%

WAIST + HGB: 6.27%

BMI + HGB: 4.32%

“More-than-chance” enrichment (observed ÷ expected under independence):

BMI+BP+WAIST: 3.90×

BMI+GLU+WAIST: 3.74×

BMI+GLU+WAIST+HGB: 2.82×

BMI+WAIST: 1.83×

BMI+WAIST+HGB: 1.61×

Depleted (occur less than chance): WAIST only (0.47×), BMI only (0.42×), WAIST+HGB (0.48×).

Hb device bias: literature suggests NFHS Hb may over-estimate anemia; hence the 11.5 g/dL sensitivity.

Random glucose is a strict screen; prevalence will be low by design.

All percentages are survey-weighted; denominators are metric-specific “has data”; “fully normal” is restricted to the all-five-present set.
